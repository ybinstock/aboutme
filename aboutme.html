<h2> Bio </h2>
<p>
l attended Rollins College and majored in Political Science and minored in International Business. Post-graduation, I spent a summer volunteering in a rural India building a school and teaching English where I met my current wife. I attended Boston University graduate school and received a MA in Energy and Environmental Analysis. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
I remained in Boston as the Operations Coordinator at DailyFeats, a web startup committed in helping people do good in their everyday life. After working there for a year, I launched Climate Scores, a website that grades congressmen on climate change legislation. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
I then joined Ashoka in Washington D.C. where I managed their online fundraising efforts and Gen Y outreach. I left to organized TEDxRosslyn and then to travel the United States and Europe for several months. 
I came to the Bay area to work at Mosaic in PR where I had the opportunity to organize a Google Hangout with Billy Parish and Bill McKibben sponsored by Google Plus. I then worked at SolarCity in sales and and as a business development associate at Change.org. Most recently, I'm working on Goodnight Chrome - an extension that helps people disconnect. 
</p>
<br>
I am passionate about technology, climate change, and entrepreneurship.
